# The two assignments for W1D3 are here


## There are two JS files in this project

- countLetters.js counts the characters in a string and returns how many instances of those characters

- countIndices.js does the same thing as count letters except:

  - it returns an object with a nested array
  - it logs the index position in which the characters appear in a string
